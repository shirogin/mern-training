        <h2>Section 1: Object Manipulation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Create a class representing a movie or TV show with properties like title, genre, release year, and a
                boolean value indicating if it's a movie or TV show.
            </li>
            <li>
                Write a function to display the movie or TV show's information in a readable format (e.g., "Title:
                Inception, Genre: Science Fiction, Release Year: 2010, Type: Movie"). you can check :

                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >To string Example</a
                >
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a method to the movie or TV show object that calculates and returns the number of years since its
                release.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Section 2: Array Operations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Create an array of movie or TV show objects, each representing a different movie or show with properties
                like title, genre, and release year.
            </li>
            <li>Write a function to find the average release year.</li>
            <li>
                Write a function that takes the array and returns a new array with only the years of movies (boolean
                value indicating it's a movie should be true).
            </li>
            <li>Write a function that checks if a given genre exists in the array.</li>
            <li>
                Write a function that takes the array of movies and shows and returns an array containing only the
                titles of TV shows.
            </li>
            <li>Write a function that finds all movies in the array with a specific genre.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Section 3: Basic Manipulations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Write a function that takes a movie or TV show title as input and returns the title without spaces and
                all letters in lowercase. (e.g., "The Lord of the Rings" should become "thelordoftherings").
            </li>
            <li>Write a function that returns the longest title in the arrays.</li>
            <li>
                Write a function that takes a movie or TV show title as input and returns the number of words in the
                title.
            </li>
        </ol>
