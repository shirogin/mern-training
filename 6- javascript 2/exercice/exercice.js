// Javascript practices

// Section 1: Object Manipulation
// 1. Create a class representing a movie or TV show with properties like title, genre, release year, and a boolean value indicating if it's a movie or TV show.
// 2. Write a toString method to display the movie or TV show's information in a readable format (e.g., "Title: Inception, Genre: Science Fiction, Release Year: 2010, Type: Movie"). check : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString#examples
// 3. Add a method to the movie or TV show object that calculates and returns the number of years since its release.

// Section 2: Array Operations
// 1. Create an array of movie or TV show objects, each representing a different movie or show with properties like title, genre, and release year.
// 2. Write a function to find the average release year.
// 3. Write a function that takes the array and returns a new array with only the years of movies (boolean value indicating it's a movie should be true).
// 4. Write a function that checks if a given genre exists in the array.
// 5. Write a function that takes the array of movies and shows and returns an array containing only the titles of TV shows.
// 6. Write a function that finds all movies in the array with a specific genre.

// Section 3: Basic Manipulations
// 1. Write a function that takes a movie or TV show title as input and returns the title without spaces and all letters in lowercase.
//    (e.g., "The Lord of the Rings" should become "thelordoftherings").
// 2. Write a function that returns the longest title in the arrays.
// 3. Write a function that takes a movie or TV show title as input and returns the number of words in the title.
